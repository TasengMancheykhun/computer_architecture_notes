* Networking
  * Communication System 
    * Components
      * Source - Transmitter - Transmission Channel - Receiver - Destination
      
      * Eg: Workstation - Modem - Public Telephone Network - Modem - Server
    
    * Issues in communication Networking
      * Bandwidth Limitation
      * Latency
      * Packet Loss

  * Network Types
    * PAN
    * LAN
    * MAN
    * WAN
    * Internet

  * Network Topology: Represents a network arrangement consisting of several nodes 
    * Bus Topology
      * All nodes connected to a single wire (called a bus)
      * Simple and effective but not fast
      * All depends on a single wire 
    * Ring Topology
      * Multiple computers, one connected to the next to complete a ring
      * A transmitting computer needs to have a token before transmitting
      * Inexpensive
      * Tough to add or remove nodes, One node crashing can disconnect the whole network  
    * Star Topology
      * 
    * Mesh Topology
    * Tree Topology
   
  * Network Interface Card (NIC)
    * Also called LAN card
    * Interface between a computer and a network

  * Wired LAN technologies
    * Ethernet
    * Token Ring
    * Token Bus
