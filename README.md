* Networking
  * Communication System 
    * Components
      * Source - Transmitter - Transmission Channel - Receiver - Destination
      
      * Eg: Workstation - Modem - Public Telephone Network - Modem - Server
    
    * Issues in communication Networking
      * Bandwidth Limitation
      * Latency
      * Packet Loss

  * Network Types
    * PAN
    * LAN
    * MAN
    * WAN
    * Internet

  * Network Topology: Represents a network arrangement consisting of several nodes 
    * Bus Topology
      * All nodes connected to a single wire (called a bus)
      * Simple and effective but not fast
      * All depends on a single wire 
    * Ring Topology
      * Multiple computers, one connected to the next to complete a ring
      * A transmitting computer needs to have a token before transmitting
      * Inexpensive
      * Tough to add or remove nodes, One node crashing can disconnect the whole network  
    * Star Topology
      * Each computer is connected to a central hub
      * All commpunication goes through the hub only
      * Simple but too much dependence on the hub
      * But the hub can be upgraded easily. Easy to troubleshoot, Cost is high 
    * Mesh Topology 
      * All nodes are connected to each other
      * Very robust, Easy to diagnose errors, privacy and security are better
      * Costly, Too much of wiring   
    * Tree Topology
      * Nodes are connected hierarchically, ultimately connecting to the top node, called as root node
      * Has atleat 3 levels of hierarchy
      * Easy to expand and manage, debug
      * Expensive, lots of cabling        
  * Network Interface Card (NIC)
    * Also called LAN card
    * Interface between a computer and a network
    * Has hardcoded address: MAC address, Physical address, Hardware address

  * Wired LAN technologies
    * Ethernet
      * Ethernet Generations:
        * Classic Ethernet (Bus topology)
        * Gigabit Ethernet/Switched Ethernet (Star topology)  
      
    * Token Ring
    * Token Bus
